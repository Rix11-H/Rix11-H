# Hi there üëã
My name is Ricky Heylen, a junior fullstack developer interested mostly in creative (javascript-based) projects.


One of the most important things you should know about me, is that I am a jack of all trades. 
For a long time I engaged this feature as a downside but nowadays, I see it as a strength.
Not only does it allow me to be creative in my work, it also allows me to be creative in my life.

When I say "creative", I probably mean a whole lot more than what primarily comes to mind. It defines me in how I handle the problems that cross my path, as well as how I interact with others.
In fact, I sometimes doubt my own creative capability. However this doubt is always opposed by my willingness to innovate, help others and think out of the box. 
I am very pleased to have noticed that this quality makes me a great asset in processes involving concept development, project management and team work in general.

As a student Interactive Multimedia Desing, I learned to develop a ton of digital skills. You should probably know that my expertise in development vastly outweighs my ability in design. That said, I do know the basics of both worlds and above all, where I fall short, I'm always eager to learn more.
